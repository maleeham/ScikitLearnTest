Data Set used can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine.

**Before attempting this lab, code snippets from following link were referred: https://elearning.utdallas.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-2115795-dt-content-rid-51234329_1/courses/2188-UTDAL-CS-6375-SEC502-88611/code.txt

Usage:
	1. The code creates a neural network for a DataSet chosen from UCI ML repository. 
		1. Dataset is read into a dataframe using Pandas.
		2. The dataset is preprocessed by analyzing and scaling the attributes.
		3. The data is randomly split into train and test parts.
		4. The training model is created using MLP classifier from Scikit learn. The parameters are chosen after many iterations for different values of each parameter and the corresponding accuracy.
		5. The evaluation is done using classification_report and accuracy_score.
		
Running the code:
	1. The code is created on Google Colab: cloud platform for python and libraries.
	2. Open the Colab link and run each cell starting from the first cell to run the code.
	3. Run successive cells for error free results.
	
Requirements:
	Since the development has been done on a cloud platform, no machine requirements are necesssary.
	Any connected web browser would work for running the project.
